Pastebin Plugin for IntelliJ


A lightweight and simple Pastebin integration plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, allowing you to quickly create and share snippets to Pastebin directly from the IDE.

1)Get your API key from https://pastebin.com/doc_api#1 and 
paste it in the API_KEY field in the PastebinApiService class(in our case I used my own API key, so you do not need to get one)
2)Run ./gradlew clean buildPlugin
3)Run ./gradlew runIde
4)Select the text you want to share and press option+command+\ and then press option+command+'
